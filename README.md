# THIS REPOSITORY HAS BEEN DEPRECATED, AND THE CODE MOVED
All code from this repository has been ported to https://github.com/bhumilharia/fnExchange-slack-1, which is a fork of
https://github.com/dnif/fnExchange-slack

The README for this repo has also being cleared, please use the above link for the full and most recent code and documentation.
The only reason the repo isn't being deleted is to preserve original commits (they aren't a lot, admittedly, but hey they're there).
